4/12/2025 - I worked on the homework assigment and while i struggled a bit, i realised my mistakes. Make sure your files are in the right spot, make sure you have the correct routes.

4/18/25 - added the fortune and created a base.html so i can use jinja


4/25/25 - added the sqlalchemy and added some of my favorite cars
    update - Realized i needed a link that displayed info about the car so i fixed that

5/1/25
To view the cars make sure you run data.py to make sure everything runs smoothly
